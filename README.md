🔢 NumPy Fundamentals
Welcome to the NumPy folder — the foundation of my Data Science journey. This section focuses on performance, efficiency, and the power of vectorized operations. If you’re transitioning from vanilla Python to NumPy, this is the spot where the magic begins.

📌 NumPy = Numerical Python = Fast, compact, and built for data science.

📁 Folder Structure
This repo is organized into thematic subfolders to help you learn progressively.

Why Use Numpy/ → Benchmarks, comparisons, and reasons why NumPy > native Python.

Other Folders (Creating Arrays/, Indexing and Slicing/, Broadcasting/, etc.) → Deep-dives into individual NumPy concepts with examples, exercises, and mini-projects.

🔍 Inside Why Use Numpy/
File	Description
01_SpeedTests.ipynb	🚀 Benchmarks the performance difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays. Spoiler: NumPy flies!
02_Creating_Arrays.ipynb	🛠️ Various ways to create arrays — zeros, ones, arange, linspace, randoms, etc.
03_MemoryEfficiency.ipynb	📉 Compares memory usage between lists and arrays. NumPy saves RAM like a pro.
04_Vectorization.ipynb	⚡ Shows how vectorization beats loops. You’ll never write a for loop again.
Exersice.ipynb	🧠 Practice notebook to solidify your understanding with bite-sized tasks.
Summary.txt	📜 Recap of everything covered — perfect for revision or quick review.

🧰 Skills You'll Practice
Array creation & manipulation

Vectorized math

Benchmarking code speed

Memory profiling

Clean, Pythonic syntax

🚀 Why NumPy Matters
NumPy isn’t just faster — it’s the gateway drug to real data science in Python. It powers libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib. Mastering NumPy means you're fluent in the language of data.

This repo is your workout zone — get in, train hard, and build that data brain 💪.
